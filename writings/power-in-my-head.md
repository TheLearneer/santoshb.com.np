  Everyone has got a brain and it is the most powerful tool any living creature has got. But every individual has got a different mind with different thinking capabilities and different processing powers. Talking about me, I got a really massive power that lies deep within my head which occasionally shows up. The power really makes me think for a while... Maybe you got this amazing power too ??

Just as everyone know, every human being has got a brain of their own, which works very uniquely to any other brains in the world. There is no replica of any human brain and no two brains can be matched on such basis. But I am preety sure that lots of brains have got much things in common. For e.g. few heads are smart and few are not so smart! And to be honest it would never be wrong to say, even a not so smart head (*like mine*) has got some power that can amaze people at times!

Well if you are thinking hard about it and already putting your brain at work, let me tell you it's not some power that I got after doing hard work. But rather its some power I got for thinking on my own! The power I think of is that my head can put me in any position with perfection over times. If you are not able to get what I mean, let me explain it with ease! Lets consider you are watching a movie, what do you like the most? The fight of hero? The romance of hero with heroine? The coolness of any character? The comedy? or simply anything else? Well while I am watching any movie and anything interesting happens, I start to live the moment of the movies in real life _with the help of the **massive power that lies in my head**!_ Its not just about watching movies, but when I see anything sad, happy, dangerous, full of action, romantic, emotional happen then the power inside my head is released and thats when I know the full potential of mine head.

Most people like to call this power of mine by the name of **adrenaline rush**, but my guesses are they are not happy with me having this awesome power. If you too have this power with you and feel people are jealous of us all, then lets all do a CHEERS! We are really unique in this world and got some amazing powers with us.

So when does this power of mine get activated?? It's really easy though! Whenver I live the moments happening in front of me, or whenever I live the moments I am thinking about! Amazing thing is that not only I get to live the moment, but also I get to do lots of things afterwards. When I watch any bollywood movies (_south indian mostly_), I really get into the entire emotions of the movie. Then when I am watching the movie I start thinking about myself being there at the same time. I laugh when the characters laugh, I get my eyes wet when anything sad happens, I get my body pumped up when there is any problem and action is about to start. Talking about it all, I live the character in the movie. Whenever I see any bad happen around me and the authorities are not taking any proper action, my head starts using its power and I get to live the moment as the authority around. I not only fix the current issue but also starting doing good for coming time.

But all this power sounds good just to hear right?? Absolutely true! This power is really awesome to have because it can give the pleasure you want, it can relieve you from lots of problems, it can give you happiness when you really need it, it can bring that smile in your face. But there aren't any real effects of this power. This power wont change anything for real. But as it is said, **When you are good, you will start making things better!** That's why I am always happy that I have this awesome power.

Take care, stay safe! Until next time when I recognize a new power that lies within me and lots of you!
