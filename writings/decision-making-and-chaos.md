  Every step in one's life demands a decision being made. Without the proper decision life can not function properly. I too have to make decisions in every step of my life. But what would you do if the decision making is not easy. Well for me, the decision I make are always full of chaos and I get into some really wiered situations every now and then!

Every step in our life demands for a decision. Either it being to choose the food to eat, what/where to read, whom to trust, or simply anything you can think up of right now. So yeah, if you are bad are making decisions you are gonna have hard time. Fortunately our parents make the decision for us while we are young but as soon as we grow up we have to do it on our own. I don't know if I am good or bad at taking decisions, but there has not been a single time without me being in complete chaos while making decisions.

I have already started taking the decisions of my life for some while now. Whether it being what I will study, what I want to do with my life, what I want to eat and any other basic things. I am really good with making decisions when the stuff is really simple. I am really fond of computers so decision of studying *computer engineering* was a walk in the park. But what I am really bad at is sticking with my decisions. *Excludes my decision of studying computer engineering though!* As you see I am already fond of computers and thus I love programming/developing tools. But what I am really bad at is keeping up with my work. Most of the works that I started are always left before completion; either due to lack of motivation or mood swing or being demotivated by someone else or some stupid excuse of mine!

I still remember the first programming project I did, I left it because there were many people demotivating me. The second major project I did was regarding a mobile game API, I left it incomplete because I had stopped playing the mobile game. The next project I did was a discord bot, I left it because I was getting inactive around discord. Next one was again an API but with lots of scope and possibilities, but I left it becuase no one was using it! Well there still goes lots of other projects that I have started and stopped working on. The list goes on forever if I start thinking about it! But in every different projects I did, the only common thing I see is **decision making and chaos**!

But still among all these projects that I started and never completed, there are few projects that I am really interested in and I am still doing those! *Well you see, I am not in complete chaos!* Those projects are still in my priority list maybe becuase I am fond of the concepts behing those projects, or well maybe the project never has an end so all I got to do is just keep an eye on them every now and then. Also I have a tendency to return to dead projects after a while. Recently as of writing this, I started working back on one of my API, but again I am getting bored of it again :P I hope you can understand me, going back and forth on stuffs! Even if I talk about something else from programming, I used to make youtube videos back in 2013-14. But again it was my bad decision making capabilities and a huge amount of demotivation I got from the viewers, I got off with the idea of making youtube videos. I recently even though to get back into it, but then I got bored! By the way if you also like pokemon stuffs like me, you can go check out my youtube channel :D

I have almost never been in chaos while making decision making if it is not realated to programming and developing. But there are times when I have regretted the decisions that I made over a long run. But there are very count of those, so I am still fine with them.

So thats about my decision making capabilities and the chaos I face while duing so. What about yours ??
