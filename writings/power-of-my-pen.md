Yeah you heard it completely right. I really got a powerful pen and it... **Hold on**, If you are already thinking of some pen with some amazing powers then you are absolutely wrong! The pen I am talking about is just the coordination of my hand and my heart. When my hand and my heart get together, someting awesome thoughts and writings are created which I can be really proud of.

I have always been bad at speaking and expressing with actions. That is one of the reason why I am not liked by people. Everytime such thing happened I used to feel sad. But once it hurt be really bad and that's when I started writing to express my feelings. Ever since, the most important thing I have realized is that people are mostly lying when they say something because they think what they speak of. The mouth of ours has strong bond with the brain, and you all already know that brain makes decision full of thoughts. On the other side, when people are sitting in peace and start feeling stuffs, they always speak the truth. Ever since I started writing stuffs I relized that my hand has some strong bond with my heart, because when I end up writing, I cannot even believe it is what I have written myself. When I feel alone, bored, sad, happy, excited, I just keep a note of it. And then I will always have the oppurtinity to relive the moment.

Whenever I get a monent in peace I start writing stuffs that come into my heart in a piece of paper or just like this softcopy. This entire writing section in the website is indeed the result of **the power of my pen!** A smile always hangs tight on my face whenever my pen gets in action or when I read those later. Bost most of the people usually find a lot of mistakes and error in them. But they never tend to understand that the mistakes are what puts the smile when you read them back.. The reason why I write is to spread happiness and express things, and you cannot expect happiness from something too usual, right ?? Thus I don't intentionally keep up those mistakes in my writings but also I don't remove any mistakes I find on reading them later.
