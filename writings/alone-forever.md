  Everyone loves to have companion and be with loved ones. But I rather prefer to be alone and I don't think if this though of mine will ever be changed at all.
  I too really do not know why I love to be alone, but I surely know why this is happening to me..

Yeah I am alone and I love to be. But it's not the exact truth. I like to be alone rather to be with bad companion. Life really is short to have pain and sorrow, but you cannot always keep yourself away from them. In order to know what happiness is one will have to face pain and sorrow. Otherwise how will one even be able to distinguish between the good and the bad. That is why I am being known to the bad stuff as of now, just so that I can find the good for myself.

I have heard of millions of people till date, met with thousands of them and I personally know hundreds but still I like to be alone. The only thing I ever wanted since my childhood was someone who could truly understand me. But I have miserably failed till date and never found someone who can understand me. I always have my family with me who can truly understand me, but life is not just bound only within family. A person needs a companion who can truly understand the feeling of oneself and be the helping hand that one needs. I wonder when my life will be blessed with what I need.

You might be already thinking this person needs someone to love. But if you are think so then you are absolutely wrong. Love has never been the priority in my life at all. Rather I always want good friends by my side; Good friends who can really say "You are doing awesome!" even when I am not, "You were the best!" even when I am the worst. That might sound idiotic to you and I agree with you. And this is why I am all alone. I like talking idiot, I like being crazy but no one has ever been able to see the actual reason behind what I do. I got some really bad habits which anyone would like at all. Thus I am alone...

My bad habit is to see my importance in next person's life. But I guess I am not important to anyone yet, that's why I am all alone. I might be too out of the box to test my importance but that is how it is. People are always great the way they are and never good when they change themself for someone else. Ever since I understood about life and started searching for a good person in life, I always avoided them. Most of them used to think I am not interested in them, lots of them used to think I have bad attitude, some of them used to think I am not worth of them but few of them still were good to me. But most of the time their reason for being so was to seek a friend with benifit. I have met few people till date who are not like any others, they are really the kind of person whom I am looking for. But good things don't last long at all. Most of them changed with time and the remaining are lost with time. And me, I am back to square 1; where I started from; Looking for someone who can actually understand me.

At the end, the fault is all mine seeking for something just perfect, but that is how I am. I prefer bearing the pain of being alone rather than regreting trusting someone who will hurt me more. I do have some valuable people in my life who can understand me to some level, but I am also sure it's all about time when things will get to the starting point once again. But I am happy I got some time to enjoy even though it's not the ideal thing as I wanted.

I have become much habituated to being alone and going for the search, now I have started enjoying it. Because after every failed attempt I get to know someone more better and I can feel I am getting better with my decisions. And me being alone, I am preety sure that will be a thing of past really soon!
