Life is all about liking something and disliking something. Someone likes eating a lot but someone else dislikes that, someone likes playing games a lot but someone else dislikes that. There is no end to liking and disliking stuffs. Talking personally about me, I have a craze beyond normal for computers ever since I first used them.

I got to use computer for the first time at the age of 12. Ever since then I have always loved exploring about computers more and more. Talking about now, I cannot even imagine my life without computers. They have become like a part of mine body now. When I saw computers for the very first time, there were lots of questions going on my head, which I believe is the reason for my craziness. I never got answers to all of mine questions, but few of those were answered after I started reading about them and lots of them were answer after I joined my bachelor's degree of Computer Engineering. But still today there are few questions that I never found answers to. My aim is simply to search for the answers, but I doubt if it is going to be easy. And this hard task is definitely something that has got my craze.

In the current scenario my daily task includes using computers no matter how busy I am or even if I am sick! Using computers has improved my knowledge about various stuffs really much. I learnt lots of stuffs while seeking for my answers but while searching for answers I almost always used to find a new question. And that is how I kept learning new stuffs day by day.
