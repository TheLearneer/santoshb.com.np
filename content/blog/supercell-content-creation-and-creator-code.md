**Supercell Creators** is a program by supercell to support all the content creators realted to the supercell games. Supercell introduced this program with the main concern to help out all the content creators who are using all the time and knowledge to help other users(players) with various stuffs. It reall is an amazing program by supercell, so let's dive into all the questions/answers that you might already be thinking of!

## What is it?
If I simply say what is stated in the official website, it's simply **"A place to help you do what you do best"**! And that is absolutely true. Lots of people(creators) have been making content around supercell games for long. In the early phases they were investing all their time and knowledge with nothing to be gained. But Ever since this program launched, creators are being appreciated by the supercell team.

## How it works?
Every creator _approved_ for the supercell creator program get their own unique code, referred to as **creator code**. You can even call them as clash of clans creator code, clash royale creator code, brawl stars creator code, boom beach creator code or simply supercell creator code, it's all upto you. This code acts as a referral code i.e. whenever you do in-app purchases in the supercell games, your favourite creator gets a certain amount of share of the purchase you just made. Also the creator code is usable across all the games that support creator program; Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Boom Beach and Brawl Stars!

**NOTE:** Creator gets the share when you make in-app purchases for Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. But for Brawl Stars they get the share when you spend the gems. _I am not sure how they work for Boom Beach though!_

## What will it cost?
**Completely nothing**! You will neither be charged anything when you make purchase nor you will be charged anything in-game. You can support your favourite content creator without having to pay anything at all.

## What will I get?
**Lots of love from the creator** if that counts! There is no direct reward for supporting content creators but there are lots of indirect reward for sure.
- Creators give back stuffs to their community in various forms like merchs, gift cards, special role/authority in their community, shoutout in their content and lots more!
- Supercell organizes various events which you can participate only through content creators; Brawl merch giveaways, Brawl skins giveaway, Royale emotes giveaway and more!

Also it's not all about getting rewards! Your support for your favourite content creator will inspire and motivate them to make more of those awesome contents. Which eventually benefits us all right? So keep entering the code everytime it expires. But if you haven't supported any creator yet, think of it again and start supporting your favourite content creator right away!

## How to use the code?
Using the code is really simple as well. You will just have to enter the code in the right location in the game. They do vary from game to game, so lets have a look at them all. 

Also there is a list of all the valid creator codes available [here](#available-codes)!

### Clash of clans
- Tap `Settings` button on the bottom left of your game screen
- Press `Show` under More Settings heading
- Scroll all the way to the bottom and click `Enter code` button in the Creator Boost section
- Enter your creator's code and show some love to them

### Clash Royale
- Switch to `Shop` tab from the bottom left of your game screen
- Scroll all the way to the bottom and click `Enter code` button in the Creator Boost section
- Enter your creator's code and show some love to them

### Brawl Stars
- Open the `Shop` from your game screen
- Scroll all the way to the right and click `Enter code` button in the Creator Boost section
- Enter your creator's code and show some love to them

### Keep a note
- Creator code expires after 7 days you used them. So make sure to enter it after every 7 days (or when you make purchase) to keep supporting your favourite content creator
- Creator codes are case insensitive. So you can enter it like `code` or `CODE` or even show your case creativity! _Though space makes difference!_
- You can stop supporting a creator by pressing the `stop` button if you are currently supporting someone. _But make sure you always support someone!_
- You can only support a single creator at a time. So if you want to support multiple creators you will have to stop supporting one and start supporting another creator!

## How do I get my own CODE?
Supercell Creator program is open for all. Which means you can simply apply for it. But there are few requirements so it won't be an easy task. Still all the information about that can be found in the [offical creators website](https://creators.supercell.com)!

## Supercell MAKE
Although this article is all about supercell creators, but I though Supercell Make deserves a mention as well. It is another of the supercell program that tries to involve it's users (_that's us_). They run various campaigns over there so that users can make various skins for brawl stars and the selected ones win amazing prize money! So if you are good at making 3D characters then you definitely need to head to the supercell make platform. Start making some amazing skins and get your hands on that prize money. All the best to you!
