## **I am new to Open source, how should I start?**
Believe me, everyone once was! You just need to get started with proper resources and guides. Here are some good resources for you:
- [Introduction to Open Source series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source)
- [How To Create a Pull Request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)
- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [Your First PR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/)
- [Awesome for Beginners](https://github.com/mungell/awesome-for-beginners)

## **I completed X-number of PR, but tracking page shows I am not done?**
Make sure your PRs are not among these:
- PRs that are automated (e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace/optimize images)
- PRs that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR)
- PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping
- Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October
- Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not
